1. how fix my wifi stable
 +You can find the firmware download for your device hardware here with instructions on how to install it here. In your case, as was mine, I downloaded the firmware for Intel® Centrino® Wireless-N 1000. NOTE: the link provided is for kernel versions 3.2+. If memory serves correctly that should work for 13.04 but to be sure run the command: uname -a. As per the instructions perform the following after downloading the firmware:
 +
 +$ tar -xvzf iwlwifi-1000-ucode-39.31.5.1.tgz 
 +$ cd iwlwifi-1000-ucode-39.31.5.1/
 +$ sudo cp iwlwifi-1000-5.ucode /lib/firmware/
 +That's it! As I stated this has worked so far. If the issue manifests itself again I will modify or delete this answer, but for mine and everyone with this problem I hope this is a permanent fix.
